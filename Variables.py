#Variables are nothing but reserved memory
# locations to store values.
# It means that when you create a variable,
# you reserve some space in the memory.
# The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
# The operand to the left of the = operator is the
# name of the variable and the operand to the right
# of the = operator is the value
# stored in the variable.

# case sensitive
# don't overwrite keywords -> print = 190 -> the mistake
